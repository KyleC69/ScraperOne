almost any blog or video/image sharing platform. Scraper One uses several strategies for acquiring media, 
PuppeteerSharp is used to surface scrape a site and OpenApi specifications to access the data in a 
behind the scenes way. Can be used to backup your websites' media when your orginal artwork may be lost.
